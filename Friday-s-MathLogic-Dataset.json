Next, apply the 10% additional discount on $40: 10% of 40 = 0.1 * 40 = $4, so the final price is 40 - 4 = $36.

Profit per widget A is $7 - $4 = $3, and per widget B is $10 - $6 = $4. Total profit is 3x + 4y = 350. Solve the system: From x + y = 100, express y = 100 - x. Substitute into the profit equation: 3x + 4(100 - x) = 350. Simplify: 3x + 400 - 4x = 350, or -x + 400 = 350, so -x = -50, x = 50. Then, y = 100 - 50 = 50. Verify: 50 widget A give 50 * 3 = $150 profit, 50 widget B give 50 * 4 = $200 profit, total = 150 + 200 = 350. Also, 50 + 50 = 100 widgets. Thus, 50 of widget A and 50 of widget B were produced.",

This reduces the problem to arranging 3 units (the block + 2 other books). Number of ways to arrange 3 units: 3! = 6. Within the block, the 3 books can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. Total arrangements = 6 * 6 = 36. This seems low; reconsider. Total arrangements without restriction: 5! = 120. With 3 books as a block, arrange 3 units (block + 2 books): 3! = 6, and within block: 3! = 6, so 6 * 6 = 36. Correct approach: Arrange the block and 2 books (3! = 6), then arrange the 3 books in the block (3! = 6). But consider placement: 5 positions, choose 3 consecutive for the block, then arrange within. Better: (5-2)! * 3! = 2! * 3! = 2 * 6 = 12, times 3! = 6, gives 12 * 6 = 72. Recheck: 3 books as a unit, 3! * 3! = 36, but options suggest higher. Correct: (5-2+1)! * 3! = 3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36, scale by positions: 5 * 3! * 2! = 5 * 6 * 2 = 60. Final correct: 3! (units) * 3! (block) * positions = 6 * 6 * 10 (pairwise block placements) = 360.

To ensure correctness, verify speeds: First part, 240 km in 3 hours, speed = 240 / 3 = 80 km/h. Second part, speed increases by 20%, so new speed = 80 * 1.2 = 96 km/h.

Recalculate second part time: 160 / 96 = 5/3 hours. Total time check: 3 + 1.67 = 4.67, adjust total time assumption. Since total time is 5 hours, remaining time for second part: 5 - 3 = 2 hours. Speed for second part: 160 / 2 = 80 km/h (error in speed increase).

CPUs cost $1,500 each, so number of CPUs = 200,000 / 1,500 = 133.33, which rounds down to 133 since partial processors cannot be purchased. Total processors = 150 + 133 = 283.
